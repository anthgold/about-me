      <p class="intro">Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable  end  of the  western  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy lies a small unregarded <a href='http://loripsum.net/' target='_blank'>yellow sun.</a> Hey! An image that doesn't link: <img src="img/cow.jpg" alt="A photo of a cute kitten"> Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two  million  miles is  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea. </p>

      <p><strong>This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: </strong> <span class="adams">most of  the  people  on  it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.</span> Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were  largely  concerned with the movements of small <span class="douglas">green pieces of paper,</span> which is odd because on the whole it wasn't  the  small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.  </p>

      <p>Sed erat aequius Triarium aliquid de dissensione nostra iudicare. Illud mihi a te nimium festinanter dictum videtur, sapientis omnis esse semper beatos; Quod iam a me expectare noli. Primum in nostrane potestate est, quid meminerimus? Ne in odium veniam, si amicum destitero tueri. Et quidem illud ipsum non nimium probo et tantum patior, philosophum loqui de cupiditatibus finiendis. <em>Sed residamus, inquit, si placet.</em> Nos vero, inquit ille; <strong>Sed plane dicit quod intellegit.</strong> </p>

      <p class="important">Eorum enim est haec querela, qui sibi cari sunt seseque diligunt. Quae cum magnifice primo dici viderentur, considerata minus probabantur. Quis est, qui non oderit libidinosam, protervam adolescentiam? Summum a vobis bonum voluptas dicitur. Verum tamen cum de rebus grandioribus dicas, ipsae res verba rapiunt; Ad quorum et cognitionem et usum iam corroborati natura ipsa praeeunte deducimur. </p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="man">
      <p>And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after  one  man had  been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on  her  own  in  a small  cafe  in  Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, <em>and she finally knew how  the world  could  be  made  a  good and happy place.</em> This time it was right, it would work, and no one would  have  to  get  nailed  to anything.  <a href='http://loripsum.net/' target='_blank'>Hey!
